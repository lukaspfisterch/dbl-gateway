# Capabilities Usage

This folder defines the client-facing capability surface of the DBL Gateway.

- `capabilities.gateway.v1.json`: machine-readable contract for clients and automation.
- `CAPABILITIES.md`: short human summary derived from the same surface.

Clients should treat these files as the authoritative description of gateway capabilities.
